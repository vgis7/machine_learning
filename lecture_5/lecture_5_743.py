# First, mix the 2-dimensional data (training data only) by removing the labels and then use one 
# Gaussian mixture model to model them. Secondly, compare the Gaussian mixture model with the Gaussian 
# models trained in the previous assignment, in terms of mean and variance values as well as through visualisation.

mat_file = loadmat("2D3classes.mat") #Loading the matfile with the 2d data for the 3 classes
